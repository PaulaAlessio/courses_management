**WARNING:** Currently, there is NO error handling. This means, if there's any 
error while filling out the forms, you will most probably end up with a 
database error making the page rendering impossible, ;-). 


**NOTE:** you can use pycharm to launch the application instead.

## How to create a dummy example

In folder `dummy_students_data` you can find data to play with. 

### Importar grupo
The first thing you have to do is to import student groups. The file formats at 
your disposal are: 

- moodle format
- ra√≠ces format

Choose one of them and fill in the _importar grupo_ form consequently. 

When you are done with it, you can go to the _Grupos_ tab and check that 
the groups you just imported are available. You can also click on the 
group names to see the list of students. 

### Crear curso 

Once your groups have been imported, you are ready to create a course 
with one or several groups. Go to hte tab: _Crear Curso_ and fill in 
the form. 

Once you are done with it, you can go to the _Cursos_ tab and see a list 
of the so far created courses. Click on an already existing course.
